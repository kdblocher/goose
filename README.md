## The Migrating Desktop Goose
Steps to a good April Fools' prank:

1. Stand up GooseServer and goose-ui somewhere in your organization
2. Build and deploy GooseAgent via user to each hapless target's workstation (so that it runs while the user is logged in)
3. Give a mole or two in your organization access to goose-ui so that they can migrate the goose
4. Laugh mercilessly as your users are harassed by a goose that causes (mostly harmless) mayhem around the office!

### Background
This project originated out of an April Fools' prank that occurred on April 1, 2021 at [Wagner Machine Company](https://www.wagner-machine.com) . Many laughs were had.
